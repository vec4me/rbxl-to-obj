# rblx-to-obj
Self-explanatory. It also converts rbxm's, though the name 'rbxlx-to-obj' is better for marketing. It only supports three primitives right now, but more are anticipated for the future, including meshes.

## Usage
Just do `rbxl-to-obj place.rbxl` and you'll get a `place.obj` file in the same directory.

The same probably works for rbxm files (haven't tested, don't care).

## Installation
```
cargo install rblx-to-obj
```
